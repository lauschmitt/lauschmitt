- 👋 Hi, I’m @lauschmitt (@laurentschmitt on Twitter)
- 👀 I’m interested in european energy data spaces and developping new generation data exchange platforms through Digital4Grids 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to best use Github while not being a code native (but being strong on core energy market processes having spent 25y in that sector)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any relevant opensource data integration layers 
- 📫 How to reach me you can email me at laurent.schmitt@digital4grids.com.
